# BACKGROUND COLORS
# bgcolor: The general background color.
# nfcolor: The background color for the event list and calendar, whichever has
# the focus.
# fcolor:  The background color for the event list and calendar, whichever does
# not have the focus.

# There are two ways of specifying these background colors. The first is simply
# to specify these colors directly, e.g., 
# bgcolor = "GRAY90"
# nfcolor = "GRAY94"
# fcolor  = "GRAY99"

# The second way is to specify a color 'family' from one of the 'numbered'
# color families supported by python. Here is a partial list:

#    "AZURE" "BISQUE" "CORNSILK" "DARKOLIVEGREEN" "DARKSEAGREEN" "HONEYDEW"
#    "IVORY" "KHAKI" "LAVENDERBLUSH" "LEMONCHIFFON" "LIGHTGOLDENROD"
#    "LIGHTSKYBLUE" "LIGHTSTEELBLUE" "LIGHTYELLOW" "MISTYROSE" "NAVAJOWHITE"
#    "PALEGREEN" "PEACHPUFF" "THISTLE" "WHEAT" 

# For each of these python supports four named colors, e.g., 'IVORY1',
# 'IVORY2', 'IVORY3' and 'IVORY4'. Simply setting
#    colorfamily = "IVORY"
# has exactly the same effect as setting
#    bgcolor = "IVORY3"
#    nfcolor = "IVORY2"
#    fcolor  = "IVORY1"
# The advantage of the family approach is that the selected colors
# automatically blend well and help indentify the window with the focus. 

colorfamily = "IVORY"

# borders: sunken (-1), flat (0) or raised (1)
# event and calendar borders
