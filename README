                                    wxRemind

   wxRemind is a graphical front-end to [1]Remind, a remarkably sophisticated
   calendar and alarm system. wxRemind is similar to [2]Wyrd but is based on
   [3]wxPython rather than curses. The display features a calendar and daily
   event list suitable for visualizing your schedule at a glance. Dates and
   associated events can be quickly selected either with the mouse or cursor
   keys, and dates in the calendar are color coded to reflect the total
   duration of scheduled events. wxRemind integrates with an external editor
   of your choice to make editing of reminder files more efficient, provides
   hotkeys to quickly access the most common Remind options, allows popup,
   sound and/or spoken alerts and can display a postscript calendar of the
   selected month suitable for printing.

                           version 0.6.8 - 2006-05-30

  Requirements

   The latest version of wxRemind should be available at [4]wxRemind.

   You will need to have remind and python >= 2.3 and, additionally, wxPython
   >= 2.6.1. For me (Centos 4 and python 2.3), installing wxPython required:

     * wxPython2.6-common-gtk2-unicode-2.6.3.0-fc2_py2.3.i386.rpm
     * wxPython2.6-gtk2-unicode-2.6.3.0-fc2_py2.3.i386.rpm

   Note: analogclock is a recent addition to wxPython (2.6.3) and is required
   for wxRemind. A copy has been included in this distribution under the
   wxWidgets license for the convenience of those with earlier versions of
   wxPython already installed.

   Displaying monthly postscript calendars requires ggv (gnome ghostview).

   Audible, spoken-message alerts require [5]Festival.

  Installation Alternatives

   Follow one of the following alternatives.

    1) Using INSTALL

   Unpack the contents of the wxRemind.tgz in a convenient location, open a
   terminal window and then at a command prompt (not as root but as
   yourself):

   $ cd <path to wxRemind directory>

   $ ./INSTALL

   and follow the instructions.

   This script prompts for a directory in your path and then creates symbolic
   links for the wxRemind executables (wxremind, wxremalert, wxremdata and
   wxremsetup) in that directory. The link to wxremalert is necessary for
   remind to be able to use it for alerts. The other links are for
   convenience.

   Using INSTALL has the following advantages:

    1. It doesn't require root privileges.
    2. It leaves your python tree untouched. To remove wxRemind simply delete
       the directory where it was unpacked and the three symbolic links
       created by INSTALL.
    3. It runs on a wide variety of platforms without tweaking. Since the
       package files are in a subdirectory of the root directory where the
       scripts are located, the scripts can automatically find the package
       files ON ANY PLATFORM without further intervention.

   Proceed to Post Installation.

    2) Using setup.py (usually requires root privileges)

   Unpack the contents of the wxRemind.tgz in a convenient location, open a
   terminal window and then at the command prompt (as root):

   # cd <path to wxRemind directory>

   # python setup.py install

   This will create an egg (a compressed zip file) and install it in the
   python tree, usually under site-packages, and install the scripts in your
   system path, usually in /usr/bin/.

   Proceed to Post Installation.

    3) Using Easy Install (usually requires root privileges)

   You do not need to download the tarball if you use this alternative.

   Download [6]ez_setup.py, and run it; this will download and install the
   appropriate setuptools egg for your Python version. An easy_install script
   will be installed in the normal location for Python scripts on your
   platform.

   Then at the command prompt (as root):

   # easy_install wxRemind

   This will download and install the egg (a compressed zip file) in the
   python tree, usually under site-packages, and install the scripts in your
   system path, usually in /usr/bin.

   Proceed to Post Installation.

  Post Installation

   At a command prompt not as root but as yourself:

   $ wxremsetup

   and follow the instructions. This configuration process will check for
   sufficiently recent versions of 'python' and 'wxPython', for the presence
   of 'remind', 'festival', 'ggv' and 'play' in your system path and for the
   existence of the default alert sound file.

   It will then create '.wxremfloat' in your home directory, overwriting any
   existing file. The contents of this file will make it possible for you to
   use floating reminders.

   Next it will check for the existence of '.reminders' and '.wxremindrc' in
   your home directory. If '.reminders' exists it will be checked to make
   sure that it contains an 'include .wxremfloat' line. If it does not, first
   a backup will be made named '.reminders.bak' and then the appropriate line
   will be inserted at the beginning of the original file. If '.reminders'
   does not exist, then it will be created with the necessary line as its
   only content.

   A new configuration file will then be created called '.wxremindrc' if this
   file does not alread exist and '.wxremindrc.new' otherwise. This file will
   automatically contain the correct settings for 'remind', 'festival', 'ggv'
   and 'play' and, of course, for 'reminders' and 'wxremfloat'.

   Finally, a report of messages generated during configuration will be
   displayed.

   IMPORTANT If created by the configuration process, it is strongly
   recommended that you edit ~/.wxremindrc.new to reflect any custom settings
   that you may have made in your existing ~/.wxremindrc, and then save
   ~/.wxremindrc.new as ~/.wxremindrc.

   You can now run wxRemind by opening a terminal window and entering

   $ wxremind

   Once wxRemind is running, pressing ? will bring up a display of usage
   information.
