0.6.8

    Bug fix. Fixed keyerror for year and month with no scheduled
    events. Added missing default entries in wxRemConfig.py for
    remind, festival, ggv, alert_play and alert_wave.

0.6.7

    Substantial changes to configuration. WXREMFLOAT/FLOAT and
    WXREMINDRC are no longer included as separate files and INSTALL
    has been modified to create links and then import wxRemSetup for
    configuration.  The files ~/.wxremfloat and ~/.wxremindrc are
    now automatically installed with the correct settings for the
    user's setup either by INSTALL or by wxremsetup. The use of the
    default ~/.reminders is assumed and an 'include .wxremfloat'
    line is inserted at the beginning of this file after making a
    backup copy, if necessary.

    Fixed alert to parse numbers only for spoken message.

0.6.6

    Added path setting and configuration check for festival.

0.6.5

    Minor cosmetic changes to analog clock. Fill color for hands and
    tick marks now set by colorfamily setting. Changed tick marks to
    circles and added black border color to hands and tick marks.

0.6.4 

    Exiting internal editor now prompts for confirmation if there
    are unsaved changes. Internal editor now returns True if the
    file has been modified and the changes saved and False
    otherwise. A refresh is only done if True.

    Added [today] to today's datebar. Minor fixes for wxRemEditor's
    buttons and tooltips.

0.6.0

    Added a simple, internal editor as the default for editing
    existing reminders.  Opens the reminders file at relevant line
    and highlights the line.

    The internal editor means that it is no longer necessary to
    create ~/.wxremindrc unless 

        1. you don't want to use the internal editor

        2. your reminders file is not the default ~/.reminders

        3. you want to customize colors or other settings

    Thus wxremind can now be run 'out of the box' with a default
    setup. (Save for including FLOAT in your reminders file.)

    Added content to the hints page.

    Stopped automatically calling the editor after creating a new
    event since it's usually unnecessary and since it's easy to
    press 'e' and bring up the editor on the just added reminder.

    New events are now appended to the reminder file using python
    rather than by the 'echo rem >> reminders' hack.  First a backup
    is made of the existing reminders file (reminders.bak), then a
    '\n' is added to the last the existing reminders if necessary
    and finally the new reminder is appended.

    Better configuration startup checks and more informative error
    messages.

0.5.5

    Made OK the default button in various dialogs so that they close
    on pressing ENTER.

0.5.4

    Improved checks for existence of ~/.wxremindrc, reminders and
    editor. Calls to editor that fail now produce alerts.

0.5.0

    Significant cosmetic improvements.

    Replaced listctrl header and statusbar with textcrtl's to solve
    background color problems and to allow selected date to be
    centered. Switched from 1 to 3 columns for event list to allow the
    use of non-monospaced fonts.

    Added configuration option for selecting font sizes, and for
    selecting background colors either by 'family' or individually.

    Selection automatically removed from event when focus switches
    from event list to calendar.

0.4.3

    Added wxremsetup for post installation configuration using
    either setup.py or easy_install.  Checks python and wxPython
    dependencies (never got the latter to work with
    install_requires), unpacks FLOAT and WXREMINDRC to a temporary
    directory and provides instructions similar to INSTALL for using
    these files to finish the installation.

    Edited index.html and README to reflect these changes.

0.4.2

    Initial attempt at setup.py configuration with access to FLOAT
    and WXREMINDRC.

0.4.1

    Added CHANGES, COPYING, FLOAT, README and WXREMINDRC to egg.

0.4 2006-05-19

    Changed version numbering to traditional format.

    Added setup.py (based on setuptools/ez_setup --- not distutils)
    and easy_install to INSTALL as optional installation methods.

2006-05-18

    Replaced calls to 'rem' with direct calls to 'remind' for the
    convenience of those whose remind installations did not include
    rem. 

    Fixed bug in specifying the default location of the reminders
    file.

    Added a 'new reminder' dialog to facilitate the process of
    creating reminders to those new to remind. Untimed, timed, alert
    and floating reminders are supported. 

    Added a page showing hints for creating new reminders.

    Added an optional status bar display of the reminder
    corresponding to the selected event --- displays the complete
    details of the selected event without the necessity of opening
    the external editor.

    When the event list takes focus, the first item is now selected
    unless another item was already selected.

    Added border styles (sunken, flat, raised) for event list,
    calendar and status bar to the configuration options.

    Removed leading zero on day in searches.

2006-05-14

    Converted INSTALL to a python script.  Better dependency checks
    and more user friendly location choice for symbolic links. Does
    not require root permissions, leaves the python tree untouched
    and should work on all platforms since the package files are
    located in a subdirectory of the directory containing the
    scripts.

    User specific customizations can now be set in ~/.wxremindrc.

2006-05-07

    New alert feature:  Reminders can now 'RUN' wxRemAlert.py
    (provided) to display a pop-up message and/or play a sound file
    or, if available, invoke festival (Festival Speech Synthesis) to
    read the event message aloud. Details and an example are
    provided in wxRemConfig.py (provided).

    New PS monthly calendar: display and optionally print a
    postscript calendar for selected month.  Uses remind's rem2ps
    and requires ggv (Gnome GhostView) for display.

    New font configuration option: font facenames and sizes for today
    button and event list, 

    New time display option: choose between twelve-hour (AM/PM) and
    twenty-four hour time displays.

    Improved, wyrd-like configuration for editor and remind strings
    (untimed, timed, etc.)

    Improved syntax for floating reminders: f(y,m,d,n) now sets a
    reminder due on y/m/d with an n day advance warning - see the
    documentation in FLOAT (provided).

    Cosmetic: Removed leading zeros from hours and days.
